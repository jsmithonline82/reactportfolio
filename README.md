--------------------------------

I added a section for a musical portfolio. Plan on moving site to a server for new funtionality

I used iFrame to integrate my existing Real Estate web site

I used RGBA for background opacity

I used a custom font

I included social media links

I attempted to use sub columns in the portfolio section

I had some quirky issues with background image, had to turn to a custom .css

I took the background image myself, so I should be okay to use it I assume.
